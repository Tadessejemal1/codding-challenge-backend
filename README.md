# Cloud Book Writer Platform - Backend

## Description

The backend of the Cloud Book Writer Platform handles user authentication, role management, and section management functionalities. It provides the necessary APIs to interact with the frontend part of the application, ensuring data persistence and secure user operations.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Securely handles user login and registration processes.
- **Role Management**: API endpoints to assign and modify user roles.
- **Section Management**: Supports CRUD operations on different sections of the platform that are accessible based on user roles.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running the JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store all user data and application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modelling) library for MongoDB and Node.js for working with MongoDB more easily.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, particularly for user authentication.

### Notes on Markdown Formatting:
- Use triple backticks (```) to start and end code blocks. This ensures that the commands are formatted correctly in the markdown file.
- The "makefile" identifier after the triple backticks for the environment variables section is to imply that the content is code, although "env" or another appropriate identifier could also be used depending on your markdown renderer.
- Ensure all textual descriptions are clear and concise, providing necessary details for users to understand the purpose of each section and command.

This format will make your `README.md` clean, professional, and useful for other developers, providing all necessary commands and descriptions for setting up and running the backend of your project.
