# Cloud Book Writer Platform - Backend

## Description

The backend of the Cloud Book Writer Platform handles user authentication, role management, and section management functionalities. It provides the necessary APIs to interact with the frontend part of the application, ensuring data persistence and secure user operations.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Securely handles user login and registration processes.
- **Role Management**: API endpoints to assign and modify user roles.
- **Section Management**: Supports CRUD operations on different sections of the platform that are accessible based on user roles.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running the JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store all user data and application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modelling) library for MongoDB and Node.js for working with MongoDB more easily.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, particularly for user authentication.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository (if not already done for the frontend setup)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/cloud-book-writer.git
   
2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**:

3. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
 npm install
```
4. **Run the server**:

```sh
 node server.js
```
5. **Configure the environment variables:**:

# Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory.
# Add the following variables:
```sh
Copy code
DB_URI=mongodb://yourMongoDBUri
JWT_SECRET=yourJwtSecret
PORT=5000
```
## API Endpoints

### Auth Routes:
- **POST /auth/register**: Registers a new user.
- **POST /auth/login**: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

### User Routes:
- **GET /users**: Retrieves all users (admin only).
- **PUT /users/:id**: Updates user information (admin only).

### Section Routes:
- **GET /sections**: Retrieves all sections accessible to the logged-in user.
- **POST /sections**: Creates a new section (admin and authors only).
- **PUT /sections/:id**: Updates a specific section (admin and authors only).
- **DELETE /sections/:id**: Deletes a specific section (admin only).

## Usage

Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the frontend or any other client that requires backend functionalities. Utilize tools like Postman or Swagger to test and document the API endpoints.

## Security Features

- All sensitive routes are protected with JWT authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database to enhance security.

## Conclusion

This backend setup provides robust support for the Cloud Book Writer Platform, handling all data management and security requirements efficiently. Ensure you follow the setup instructions carefully to get the backend running smoothly.
